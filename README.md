    `http://<api_host>`
    
- Get the maximun vale of any sensor 

    `http://<api_host>/max`
    
GET and POST methods are supported:

- The GET method looks inside the parameters for the sensor to watch. The request could be performed as folllows:

    ```
    http://<api_host>/max?sensor=<sensor>
    
    http://<api_host>/max?sensor=CO2
    
    .....
    
    http://<api_host>/max?sensor=dust 
    
    etc..
    ```
- For the POST method, you must include a json file with the request:

    `{“sensor”:”<sensor>” }`

For instance, using cUrl would be something like this:

    curl -X POST -d "{\"sensor\":\"CO2\"}" 127.0.0.1/max
